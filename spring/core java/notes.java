/// default will be double in case of foalt/double
/// use f character like 5.6f to make it float /// /// type casting /// implicit type casting = automatic type conversion /// explicit type casting = manual type conversion /// /// 
/// it work with unicode character set of two byte size
/// for long also wee need to add l character like 1234l 
/// for working with binary we can use 0b or 0B like 0b1010 will give value of 10
/// same for hexadecimal we can use 0x or 0X like 0x1A will give value of 26
/// / for octal we can use 0 like 012 will give value of 10
